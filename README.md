Overview
The BigNumber class is designed to handle arbitrarily large numbers that exceed the storage capacity of standard data types. It stores numbers as character arrays, allowing for efficient representation and manipulation of very large integers. This class provides a range of arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, enabling users to perform calculations on large numbers with ease.

Features
Storage: Numbers are stored in a dynamically allocated char array, allowing flexibility in the size of the number being represented.
Arithmetic Operations: The class supports basic arithmetic operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Comparison: The class provides methods to compare BigNumber objects, facilitating easy sorting and ordering.
Input/Output: Custom input and output functions allow for easy integration with standard input and output streams.
